This program implements the balanced binary search tree proposed in the paper "Balanced Search Trees Made Simple" by Arne Anderson.

The tree is generic - meaning it can store arbitrary comparable types.
The in-order traversal of the tree is implemented in an iterative fashion.

The unit tests for testing the program are included in the files.
